# SortingAlgorithmVisualiser

Just a simple React project that allows the user to choose a sorting algorithm and visualise it as it works. The user can also control the number of elements in the array and the speed that it happens.

Some fun beeps and boops too.

There are currently 6 algorithms:

1. Bubble
2. Insertion
3. Selection
4. Merge
5. Quick
6. Heap
